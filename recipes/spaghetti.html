    <h3>Spaghetti Bolognese: Traditional Pasta Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Spaghetti bolognese is a traditional Italian recipe made of tomato sauce,
        minced mear and milk, that is its secret ingredient. But what is the 
        difference between bolognese and meat sauce? They're essentially the same, 
        but bolognese sauce is thicker and creamier, while meat sauce is an 
        American meat-based recipe mostly open to variations.
